					<small>Introductions</small>
					<h2>What I'm Hoping to Achieve</h2>					
					<p class="fragment">I want you to go away from this talk with enough interest in the concept of computational thinking that you'll think about it after leaving the room, and maybe even apply it to your work.</p>
<p class="fragment">I want you to feel that you already have relevant skills and patterns of thought for working with technology, even if you consider yourself "non-technical".</p>          
					<small class="fragment">(I am also hoping not to bore you)</small>

					<h2>Who Are You?</h2>					
					<p class="fragment">I don't know all of you, so I'm going to ask. A show of hands for:</p>
					<ul>
					<li class="fragment">I work in public service</li>
					<li class="fragment">I work in support services</li>					
					<li class="fragment">I'm a manager or administrator</li>

				<section>
					<small>Who Is This For?</small>
					<h2>The "non-technical" myth (1)</h2>					
					<p class="fragment">An increasingly small amount of library work (and work in general, in 21st-century North America) is unmediated, untouched, unencumbered or unfrustrated by technology.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<small>Who Is This For?</small>
					<h2>The "non-technical" myth (2)</h2>					
					<p class="fragment">I consider the "technical" / "non-technical" divide to be a pernicious one that prevents us from having effective conversations professionally or in our workplaces about the influence, role and values of technology in libraries.</p>
					<small class="fragment">(I use "values" here in both possible meanings)</small>						
				</section>

				<section>
					<small>Who Is This For?</small>					
					<h2>I'm pitching this talk at:</h2>					
					<ul>
					<li class="fragment">The "non-technical" library worker</li>
					<li class="fragment">"Non-technical" library administrators or managers</li>
					<small class="fragment">(Please stay even if you don't fit these two categories, though!)</small>

					<h3 class="fragment">Jeanette M. Wing:</h3>
					<blockquote cite="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/publications/Wing06.pdf" class="fragment">"Computational thinking is a way humans solve problems; it is not trying to get humans to think like computers. Computers are dull and boring; humans are clever and imaginative. We humans make computers exciting. Equipped with computing devices, we use our cleverness to tackle problems we would not dare take on before the age of computing and build systems with functionality limited only by our imaginations."</blockquote>

					<h2>Cataloguing Standards (1)</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Decomposition: we've got a lot of books and we want people to be able to find the relevant ones more quickly</p>

					<h2>Cataloguing Standards (2)</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Pattern Generalization and Abstraction: what matters and does not matter among the common characteristics of books for the specific problem we are trying to solve?</p>										
					<p class="fragment">Algorithm Design: here is how to record and interpret the common characteristics of a book in a systematic, replicable way to support organization and discovery.

				<section>
					<small>Libraries and Computational Thinking</small>
					<h2>Reference Interviews (1)</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Decomposition: people seldom ask directly for the information they actually want</p>										
					<p class="fragment">Pattern Recognition: there are discernable common aspects to the interaction when someone approaches the reference desk, asks a question, and receives a response</p>

While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is only one way of doing 'it.'"</blockquote>

					<h2 class="fragment">A personal view (1)</h2>
					
					<p class="fragment">There are lots of problems with how libraries use technology</p>
<p class="fragment">Part of the problem is the conversation</p>	
<p class="fragment">We alternately fetishize or mistrust technology</p>				
<p class="fragment">And many of us (even those of us who work daily with technology!) feel alienated from our work by it, often with justification</p>

					<h2 class="fragment">A personal view (2)</h2>
					
					<p class="fragment">The excitement I have about computational thinking is my sense that it could help change the conversation</p>			
					<p class="fragment">We need to talk more effectively across the "technical" / "non-technical" divide</p>								
					<p class="fragment">And we need to be universally better at questioning the ability of automation and technology to solve our problems, while acknowledging their immense power</p>
